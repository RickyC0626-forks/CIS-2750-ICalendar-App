# CIS-2750
Software Systems Development and Integration. Methods for organizing and constructing modular systems, manipulating files, an introduction to interface design, and use of databases

Implementation of the program:

    -> ICalendar files extracted into databases and webpages
     -> Able to create own ICalendar files via user interface and check its validity
     -> Error handling included (Ex. Invalid Event, Alarm...)   
    -> Using C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL
     -> FrontEnd and BackEnd development
      -> Use of JSON and node.js to communicate between C and JavaScript
        -> C handles the parsing of the ICalendar
        -> While JavaScript will translate the data extracted into the webpage and MySQL
      -> The client-side (browser) component is the graphical user interface GUI
      -> The server-side (backend) component will describe the server-side functionality 
      that will interact with the parser library written in C, and communicate with the web client
      
Issues with the program:

    -> Unable to extract the Alarm Table into the webpage
